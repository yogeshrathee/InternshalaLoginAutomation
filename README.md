## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Installed and configured on your system.
- **Maven:** To manage project dependencies.
- **Google Chrome:** The browser that will be automated.
- **Chrome WebDriver:** Download the appropriate version for your browser from [ChromeDriver downloads](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).
- **IDE:** An integrated development environment like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## Project Setup

### Download and Configure WebDriver

1. Download the ChromeDriver executable.
2. Update the path to the `chromedriver.exe` in your code:

    ```java
    System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\path\\to\\chromedriver.exe");
    ```

## Running the Script

### Open the Project in Your IDE

1. Import the project into your IDE.
2. Navigate to the `Main.java` file located in `src/main/java/org/example/Main.java`.

### Update Credentials

Replace the placeholders in the script with your actual credentials:

```java
emailField.sendKeys("your-email@example.com");
passwordField.sendKeys("your-password");


1. **Run the Main class.**
2. The script will open the Internshala login page, enter the credentials, and log you in.

Best Practices
Secure Credentials: Avoid hard-coding credentials in the source code. Use environment variables or external configuration files.
WebDriver Compatibility: Ensure that your WebDriver version matches your Chrome browser version.
Page Object Model (POM): For larger projects, consider using POM to structure your code for better maintainability.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected scenarios during script execution.
Future Improvements
Test Coverage: Expand test cases to cover different login scenarios, such as incorrect credentials and password reset.
Reporting: Integrate a reporting tool like ExtentReports for better insights into test execution.
Cross-Browser Testing: Extend the automation script to support multiple browsers (e.g., Firefox, Edge).
